@ NOTE: This defeat text actually causes a buffer overflow. It's too long for the gDisplayedStringBattle
@ buffer that it's put into, and it stomps all over the gBattleTextBuffs after, as well as the otherwise
@ unused array after that, sFlickerArray. Perhaps that's the reason why said array exists.
