libwiigui is a GUI library for the Wii, created to help structure the
design of a complicated GUI interface, and to enable an author to create
a sophisticated, feature-rich GUI. It was originally conceived and written
after I started to design a GUI for Snes9x GX, and found libwiisprite and
GRRLIB inadequate for the purpose. It uses GX for drawing, and makes use
of PNGU for displaying images and FreeTypeGX for text. It was designed to
be flexible and is easy to modify - don't be afraid to change the way it
works or expand it to suit your GUI's purposes! If you do, and you think
your changes might benefit others, please share them so they might be
added to the project!

### Credits

The original library was wholly designed and written by Tantric. 
Some modifications have been made by KittyPBoxx mostly for mp3 support,
and the ui for the numeric number pad.  
Thanks to the authors of PNGU and FreeTypeGX, of which this library makes use. 
Thanks also to the authors of GRRLIB and libwiisprite for laying the foundations.
Thanks to mvit for the artwork and Peter de Man for the music used in the
template.
